1. Intro                                                          *QTPYIntro*

A simple way of running single or multiple python unit tests from within VIM
based on the cursor location.

Useful for receiving immediate feedback as you write tests, despite what test
runner or framework your project uses to run its tests.

==============================================================================
2. Usage                                                          *QTPYUsage*

To use this plugin, make sure ftplugins are enabled, via "filetype on" in your
.vimrc.

For running tests the plugin provides 3 arguments with an optional one. 
These arguments are::

    class
    method
    file


As you may expect, those will focus on the tests for the current class, method,
or the whole file.

If you are in a class and want to run all the tests for that class, you would
call this plugin like::

    :QTPY class

Whenever a command is triggered a small message displays informing you that
the plugin is running a certain action. In the above call, you would see 
something like this::

    Running tests for class TestMyClass

If you would like to see the complete qtpy output you can add an optional `verbose`
flag to any of the commands for QTPY. For the previous command, it would
look like::

    :QTPY class verbose

This would open a split scratch buffer that you can fully interact with. You
can close this buffer with ':wq' or you can hit 'q' at any moment in that buffer
to close it.

When tests are successful a green bar appears. If you have any number of fails
you get a red bar with a line-by-line list of line numbers and errors.

I recommend mapping keys to QTPY commands for easy running. To do so, insert
commands like this into your .vimrc::

    " qtpy
    au FileType python nnoremap <F8> :QTPY method verbose<CR>
    au FileType python nnoremap <F9> :QTPY session<CR>

    au FileType python nnoremap <silent><Leader>c <Esc>:QTPY class verbose<CR>

The 'au FileType python' ensures these

3. Configuration                                                *QTPYConfig*
-------------
qtpy is configured to work with nosetests by default, however, using qtpy with 
other unit tests runners is simple. Just set the necessary variables in your
vimrc. 

For example, insert these lines into your .vimrc to use QTPY with Py.Test::

    " for use with Py.Test
    let g:qtpy_shell_command = "py.test --tb=short" "py.tests
    let g:qtpy_class_delimiter = "::"
    let g:qtpy_method_delimiter = "::"

The delimiter variables are used with constructing the test path to pass into
the test runner. Such as "py.test /testfolder/testfile.py::TestClass::TestMethod"
for the example above where the first '::' is the class_delimiter and the second
is the method_delimiter

==============================================================================
4. Shell Support                                                *ShellSupport*

This plugin provides a way to have a better shell experience when running
`verbose` or `pdb` flags by using the `Conque.vim` plugin. If you have this
most excellent piece of Vim plugin (see: http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2771)
then `pytest.vim` will use that instead of Vim's own dumb shell environment.

Thanks to Alfredo Deza for writing Pytest.vim, an easy to use VIM plugin for
running py.test unit tests as conveniently as possible.

The core functionality of this plugin was brought over from pytest.vim
